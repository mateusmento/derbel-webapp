As a user

	in users
As a business owner
I Want to make use of gamefication and a reward mechanism

In Order to track the progress of my task
As a user
I Want to move tasks  of my to-do list through different stages
	of progression (To do, doing, done)

In Order to record the timing of my task
As a user
I Want to be able to announce when I started doing a task, when
	I paused/continued and when I completed so that the total time
	can be calculated using the time of each of those stages
